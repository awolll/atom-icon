# This is a replacement icon for the Atom editor
> Since I am going to be needing a decent code editor and this one seemed nice but lacked an icon I wanted to see every day...

My personal favorite:
Rainbow Hero, redux
![Shiny, new Atom icon](atom_rainbow-hero.png)


The first:
![Shiny, new Atom icon](atom-icon.png)

Rainbow Hero, black typo
![Shiny, new Atom icon](atom-icon_rainbow-hero_black.png)

Rainbow Hero, white typo
![Shiny, new Atom icon](atom-icon_rainbow-hero_white.png)



*Sketch files included. Also the project file of Icon Slate, a Mac program I used to create ICNS files from PNGs.
